# Project #4 - so_long

This project is a small 2D game and one of the first graphic project of 42 school.

Its purpose is to work with:
- textures,
- sprites,
- colors,
- window management,
- event handling,
- algorithms (pathfinding),
- and some other gameplay elements.

The main constraint was to use the MiniLibX, the 42 school graphical library.

This library was developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images and deal with keyboard and mouse events.
